<div id="text">

I'm <strong>Colin Madland</strong>, the Director of TWU Online at <a href="http://twu.ca">Trinity Western University,</a> and formerly the e-Learning Facilitator and Coordinator for Educational Technologies for <a href="http://tru.ca">Thompson Rivers University</a>. I've previously taught high school physical education and digital media technologies in addition to a whole bunch of other courses.

I've got a <a href="http://merelearning.ca">personal blog</a>, and I'm playing around with <a href="http://known.merelearning.ca">KNOWN</a>, a social website that allows me to publish my own content on my server and then syndicate it to web tools like <a href="https://twitter.com/colinmadland">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/colinmadland/">Flickr</a> as I see fit...or not.

In May 2014, I completed my <a href="http://bit.ly/1mmcyeG">Master of Education thesis</a> about student interactions in online distance learning. Feel free to have a look.

As a guy living in Kamloops, BC, but commuting weekly to Langley, I <del>can</del> used to be able to bike to and from work for the better part of 10 months a year, including both the coldest (-20C; 253K for you non-metric folks) and hottest (+41C; 313K) days in the last year. You can find my rides on <a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/1782368">Strava</a>.

<!-- This is where the interesting stuff happens - the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). You can style each element that you've defined above. It's all pretty self-explanatory and, because you've got a preview window to the left and an undo button above, it's worth just tinkering around until you get what you want. One final thing: if you click on an element (e.g. "iframe") a yellow question mark will pop up. Click on that and it'll take you to the Mozilla Developer Network where you can find out more about that element. Have fun! Doug http://dougbelshaw.com Thanks Doug! Colin. -->
