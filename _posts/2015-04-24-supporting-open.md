We've been renovating around here, so the facilities folks pulled all the front faces of the cabinets and drawers in the kitchen.

In a sense, the results that you see below are similar to what happens when you release your work under an open license. Previously, there was only a 'public' view of the counter top with the sink, coffee makers, kettle, microwave and such.

But simply removing the barriers, it is a little jarring to see what is hidden by the doors. The first thing that I noticed was that there is a Keurig 'coffee maker' in the cupboard above the microwave. Nobody knew it was there. Not even the administrator who purchased a Tassimo machine for the floor for Christmas (it's hidden behind the kettle in the image).

One of the benefits of 'Open' is that we can drastically reduce redundant efforts by repurposing materials that have already been designed, edited, and vetted.
