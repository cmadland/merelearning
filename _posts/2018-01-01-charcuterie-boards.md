<h5>I made a charcuterie board over the holidays.</h5>

Actually, I started out wanting to make a cutting board. An end grain cutting board. <a href="https://www.thenavagepatch.com/end-grain-cutting-board-tutorial/">Inspired by this one</a>. But it turned out so good looking that I'm calling it a charcuterie board.

First up, a shot of the finished product.

<h5>Raw Materials</h5>

My dad has been a wood-wizard for a long time and he has a whole mess of scraps lying around the shop, including these pieces ofÂ  (l-r) birch, walnut, mahogany, and purple heart. I figured these four species would provide some good contrast to create an interesting design.

First step was to rip each board into strips. The purple heart was the shortest I had, so I cut the longer boards down to match, about 50 cm. I ripped the resulting boards into various widths, between about 2 and 5 cm wide.

Here are all the strips cut to size and arranged into what I thought might be a nice order for my cutting board. This was also shortly after I discovered that I had enough strips for 5 or 6 cutting boards. Cool.

Since my dad's planer is 33 cm wide, I measured things out and discovered that I could get 6 boards between about 30 and 33 cm wide.

Seemed like a good idea to do a test run with one board before making the same mistake with all of them right off the bat. Here is the first one set up for the first round of gluing. The middle strip is walnut, and everything else in this one is birch.

Once the strips were set up, I rotated each of them 90 degrees, and applied the glue.

Notice the third strip from the left? Too rough, so I planed it down a little. Here it is glued up and ready to cure in clamps.

Next morning, I used a nice sharp chisel to scrape the glue bits off before sending it through the planer.
