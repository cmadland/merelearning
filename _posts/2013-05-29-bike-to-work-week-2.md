It is fantastic to see so many people getting on board with BTWW this year. <a href="http://app.strava.com/activities/afternoon-ride-56859674?ref=1MT1yaWRlX3NoYXJlOzI9ZW1haWw7ND0xNzgyMzY4" target="_blank">Here is my ride home yesterday...</a>

It was my first time up Pac Way this year and my first ride in a couple weeks, so I felt pretty slow.

Keep the rubber side down.
