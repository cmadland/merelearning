<p>I&#8217;d like to focus my efforts during The You Show towards creating a platform for my work, reflections, learning and such. My intent is to end up with a media-rich portfolio/cv that can include elements from my research, plans, projects and various interests. Seems appropriate&#8230;</p>
<p>So far, I&#8217;m grateful for the input from Alan and Brian in terms of providing the technical scaffolding necessary to make this a coherent site and also the inspiration to do it with more style than I might otherwise be able to muster.</p>
<p>Here in week one, we are presented with the opportunity to create an organizational structure for a portfolio site, one that I would like to be informed by the Alan&#8217;s presentation on the shape of stories.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m at the brainstorming stage right now and used <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php?Download" >FreeMind</a> to generate a map of the structure that I think is a good starting place for this site.</p>
<p><a href="http://lab.merelearning.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/My-Gig.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-41 size-full" src="http://lab.merelearning.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/My-Gig.jpeg" alt="My Gig" width="731" height="547" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not entirely convinced yet that there will be that many actual categories on the site, because that seems excessive, but maybe it&#8217;s relatively normal? I am regularly surprised by WP and how robust it is. Perhaps only the &#8216;teaching&#8217; and &#8216;learning&#8217; categories will be that deep, while the others will stay relatively shallow.</p>
<p>As you can see below, I&#8217;ve got my category hierarchy started.</p>
<p><a href="http://lab.merelearning.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/categories.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-43 aligncenter" src="http://lab.merelearning.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/categories.png" alt="categories" width="289" height="189" /></a></p>
<p>When I was tooling about last night, I started off with a hierarchy of pages, then the &#8216;Portfolio&#8217; post-type enabled with the <a href="http://jetpack.me/" >JetPack </a>plugin. However, after reading <a href="http://youshow.trubox.ca/about/schedule/unit-1/" >&#8216;The Boys&#8217; argument</a> against using pages, I will head down the path of using categories to organize posts. I hope that it will allow for greater flexibility in displaying content where I want it and not where I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It does seem that the &#8216;portfolio&#8217; post-type uses categories (renamed as &#8216;Portfolio Types&#8217;) and that they are actually posts, but the portfolio project I started last night didn&#8217;t show up in the feed on the main page. Perhaps this is only an indication that the problem would be limited to this course and sending my feed to YouShow&#8230;perhaps not.</p>
<p>As this structure evolves over the next little while, and I add media content, I hope that there will be more of a story arc evident in the site.</p>
<p>Comments welcome.</p>
<p>PS. Anyone have a quick way to change the Â© notice at the bottom of every page to a CC license?</p>
