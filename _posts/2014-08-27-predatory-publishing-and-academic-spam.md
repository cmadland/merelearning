I received the following email today.
<blockquote>Dear Colin Madland,

I came to know about your academic paper entitled "Structured student interactions in online distance learning: Exploring the study buddy activity", while I was performing research at the Athabasca University's repository.

We are currently planning publications in this subject field and therefore we would be glad to know whether you would be interested in publishing the above mentioned work with us.

LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing is a member of an international group having nearly 10 years of experience in the publication of high-quality research works from well-known institutions worldwide.

In addition to producing printed scientific books, we also market them worldwide through more than 80,000 booksellers.

Kindly let know if you would be interested in receiving more detailed information in this regard.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Lisa Thompson
Acquisition Editor

Fortunately, I did a quick search on the company and my suspicions were confirmed. LAP is a predatory publisher which targets recent graduates and will require you to sign over the rights to your work, disallowing you from publishing more than 80% of it anywhere else. They will offer your (my) thesis as a printed book through Amazon at a grossly inflated price and provide a few printed copies for you.

My prediction is that I would sell between 0 and 1 copies for the 'benefit' of having my thesis printed and the cost of my rights to publish my work.

Sounds like a bad deal to me.

It would seem that they have been at this for a while...
