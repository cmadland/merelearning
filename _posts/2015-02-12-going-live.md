<p>I&#8217;ve been slowly moving the structure that I&#8217;ve started here over to my main site at <a href="http://merelearning.ca/" >merelearning.ca</a>. It has been good to have this spot to test things out, work out some theme kinks and quirks and just figure out how this thing can all work together.</p>
<p>I have a couple of presentations coming up and I&#8217;m experimenting with building the supporting visuals here on the blog using the &#8216;one page&#8217; idea that is common on many contemporary sites. My presentation at the TRU Teaching Practices Colloquium will be on the faculty development course that I designed for TRU faculty and some of the things I&#8217;ve learned in developing in WordPress using the LearnDash plugin. You can see my preliminary ideas at <a href="http://merelearning.ca/teaching/communities-to-ignite-learning/" >http://merelearning.ca/teaching/communities-to-ignite-learning/.</a></p>
<p>The first row in the presentation takes a while to load as it is a 6MB video file, so I&#8217;ll have to work on getting a smaller video in there.</p>
<p>My hope is that using WP to host these presentations will create a series of lasting resources after the fact. I&#8217;ll also be able to use widgets to pull in updated posts, tweets, categories, and other items over time, meaning that the presentation will be automagically updated over time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve hidden some of the items in the main menu as they currently don&#8217;t go anywhere, but as they get built, I&#8217;ll update.</p>
<p>In other news, new pix uploaded to Flickr. Well, not really new as some of them are a decade old, but they are new to you.</p>
