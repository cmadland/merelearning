<p>I have a bit of a weird relationship with the arts.</p>
<p>I appreciate the beauty of a wide variety of music, architecture, literature and such. I married a woman with a degree in music whose major instrument throughout her degree was voice, but who is also an accomplished pianist and can play a guitar, a little. [Is that like saying &#8216;I have a friend who is _____!&#8217;?]</p>
<p>I also appreciate design and the power of images. My wife, however, the aforementioned artist, does not understand why I think comic sans is a font for kids and why I react with snobbish disdain when an adult uses comic sans in typed communication to other adults. Last May at our annual OLFM Workshop, I invited <a href="http://lisathiessen.ca/" >Lisa Thiessen</a> to come and graphically record the sessions.</p>

<p>As you can see, she is good.</p>
<p>So, what of my fine motor skills? Well&#8230;not so much. I have had difficulty drawing stick figures all my life, my handwriting is horrific. Pretty much every artistic endeavour I undertake ends up looking like <a href="http://nobodygetshurt.tv/musicgif/eonDLiger0.gif" >this</a> (with bonus points for comic sans).</p>
<p>Or does it&#8230;</p>
<p>Here is something I drew when I was living in Japan.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2553" src="http://lab.merelearning.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_1432-e1422551827436-1024x470.jpg" alt="Rice under the sun." width="1024" height="470" /></p>
<p>Yesterday, I was in a meeting and we were thinking through the structure of a webpage for the faculty development course I&#8217;ve created and I suggested that we could have a landing page in WordPress to which participants are directed after registration. I managed to draw an outline of the setup on the whiteboard, and then it became clear that the landing page was redundant, so I drew a black &#8216;X&#8217; through it. As conversation continued, we realized that the landing page needed to be replaced by a person&#8230;so I drew a circle.</p>
<div id="attachment_2549" style="width: 144px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2549 size-medium" src="http://lab.merelearning.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_1430-e1422550045635-134x300.jpg" alt="Drawing Skillz" width="134" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Drawing Skillz</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the designers in the room recognized the brilliance of what had just (accidentally) happened.</p>
<p>Then last night I was <a href="http://cogdog.trubox.ca/2015/01/28/todays-oneword/" >inspired</a> to summarize my day in one word and to make it fancy. I downloaded the free <a href="https://www.fiftythree.com/paper" >Paper app by FiftyThree</a> and got to play on my iPad. My WotD was determined to be DWaB (Dude With a Beard). After just a few tests and getting used to the interface, I got the word onto the paper and started in on making it fancy with Nancy&#8217;s five shapes. Triangles and squares are pretty easy, circles a little harder, but spirals are surely the spawn of Satan himself.</p>
<p>Here is what I ended up with.</p>

<p>Apparently my ability to accidentally draw people with letters and circles is a bit of a superpower.</p>
