I find it very gratifying that at least three of these trends are already priorities that I have formalized in my goals for 2014.

Most relevant to my work is the trend towards 'just-in-time' resources for faculty in need, a strategy that I have employed in managing our faculty training needs as we transition to a new LMS.

I have not only saved a whole lot of work by having resources ready to go, but I haven't wasted valuable faculty time by providing synchronous, formalized training 6 months or a year before most of our faculty were ready.
