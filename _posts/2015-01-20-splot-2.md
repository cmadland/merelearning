TRU has been blessed to have <a href="http://twitter.com/cogdog" target="_blank">@cogdog</a> visiting us since the end of October-ish, and he and <a href="http://twitter.com/brlamb" target="_blank">@brlamb</a> have been work/playing with an idea called <a href="http://splot.ca/" target="_blank">SPLOT</a>.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Splot" href="http://flickr.com/photos/x1brett/9291502246"><img class=" aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2820/9291502246_8c78600d66.jpg" alt="Splot" /></a>

The idea is to create very simple tools that students can use without logins or any need to identify themselves. Part of the impetus for the project is to appease the <strong><em>GUARDIANS of PRIVACY</em></strong> â„¢.

One of the tools was in beta-test this morning, so by now should be ready to go and it allows users to upload CC images and contribute to a pool of images. Check out <a href="http://imagepool.trubox.ca" target="_blank">imagepool.trubox.ca</a>.

I'd like something similar, but for creating an annotated, crowd-sourced list of useful resources and references.

Input would be similar to the web form at <a href="http://Zotero.org" target="_blank">Zotero.org</a>.
<!-- copy and paste. Modify height and width if desired. --> <a href="http://content.screencast.com/users/cmadland/folders/Jing/media/8f6289fc-3eaa-424d-a18b-f70d0dba0ce0/00001560.png"><img class="embeddedObject" src="http://content.screencast.com/users/cmadland/folders/Jing/media/8f6289fc-3eaa-424d-a18b-f70d0dba0ce0/00001560.png" alt="" width="596" height="442" border="0" /></a>

The key data to collect would be what would typically be found in a bibliography in an academic paper. Each entry would become a new post on a blog accessible to everyone in the class, which could then be exported to a reference manager like <a href="http://Zotero.org" target="_blank">Zotero</a> or <a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a>.

Whaddya think?
