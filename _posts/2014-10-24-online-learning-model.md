As I have <a title="@KOOL" href="http://merelearning.ca/education/kool/">indicated previously</a>, SD73 has a tremendous resource in <a href="http://kool.sd73.bc.ca/" target="_blank">@KOOL</a>. Unfortunately, enrolments in @KOOL have declined this year.

At a time when online learning is expanding at an extremely rapid rate in post secondary education, and many universities are beginning to require students to take at least one online course in order to graduate, we should be investing much more time, money, and effort into growing @KOOL into a vibrant online learning community like those described by Drs. Terry Anderson and Jon Dron of Athabasca University (my <em>alma mater</em>) in their new book <em><a title="Teaching Crowds" href="http://news.athabascau.ca/au-press/teaching-crowds-book-online-learning/" target="_blank">Teaching Crowds</a>.</em>

Not only could @KOOL continue to serve the needs of remote students in SD73, who need access to high quality learning opportunities, but it could also serve the needs of our face-to-face teachers and students as well.

These 'blended' learning environments are those which capitalize on the advantages of both face-to-face and online contexts to enable students to better meet intended learning outcomes. It is important that blended environments not simply add technology to dated practices. Instead, online and blended learning allows student work to be shared with the community and to contribute to our collective knowledge, experience and wisdom.

Remember all those papers you wrote in high school? Where are they now? Who read them?

There is at least one group of students in Kamloops who have become authors and have shared their work (for free) with the world. Check out the link in the tweet below. [This is not an endorsement from Mr. Reid.]

The teachers of SD73 need support for the excellent work they are already doing and for what they could do to integrate technology into their teaching practices.
