As is standard for his blog, Tom Whitby has released an insightful <a href="https://tomwhitby.wordpress.com/2015/07/14/is-isolation-in-education-a-choice/" target="_blank">post</a> on the problem of isolation in education. Teaching has long been seen as a very isolating profession with teachers having very limited opportunity to collaborate with their peers, even those in the same building or department.

This is even more pronounced among those educators who teach their students remotely via technology.

Fortunately, the same technological advances that have allowed for asynchronous collaboration between students also allows distance educators to connect with each other. As a result, according to Tom:
<blockquote>What that means in terms of education is that educators are only isolated by choice. As I have said in the past, any educator has the right to choose to live in a cave, but they donâ€™t have the right to drag students in there with them.</blockquote>

While connecting with other educators, whether across the hall or across the world, requires some investment in a relationship, those relationships can and will pay huge dividends for those who invest.

One of the easiest ways to start making connections is to sign up for an account with <a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and follow a few key influencers there.

Some accounts that you might want to check out include:
