So, it appears that I have convinced my <a title="Selah" href="http://merelearning.ca/selah-2/" target="_blank">daughter</a> to take a little foray into blogging. She has registered to complete a creative writing independent study course at school, and she seems willing to post her writing here and eventually build a nice little portfolio of writing and photography.

I'm sure you'll appreciate her work. Please leave comments!
