<p>With Monday being Family Day here in BC, the long weekend was welcome, and the weather was beautiful. My last post was a bit of a highlight reel of pics from my jaunt to Peterson Creek Park on Sunday afternoon with two of my kids. It was a good time, but we turned back short of the main falls as the creek was running pretty high with the runoff and the combination of mud, snow, wet rocks, a six-year-old, and a fancy-schmancy camera was a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>My suspicions of this were confirmed by the dude who, clearly having had a few wobbly-pops, told us to just trust our footing and go for it&#8230;then promptly fell into the creek.</p>
<p>Monday, the plan was to return without Isaac and try to make it all the way to the falls. Alan mentioned on the Twitter that he had been wanting to get to Peterson Creek, so we made arrangements to pick him up on our way.</p>
<p>The weather was less than stellar on Monday, but I thought it might make for some nice moody fog pictures, so off we went.</p>
<p>Turns out that the trail to the falls was taped off due to an active rock slide in the area&#8230;what a difference a day makes. So, we changed plans and headed down to the creek to catch some close-ups and maybe some audio and video. The little spot we ended up at had been visited not too long before as there were several little inukshuks that always make for interesting pics.</p>

<p>After that, we headed over to TK&#8217;emlups land on the other side of the river to check out St. Joseph&#8217;s Church.<br />

<p>I ended up with some stock video and audio of the creek and the swirly flame in the cemetery across the road from St. Joseph&#8217;s. I have already used the flame footage as background in a presentation I&#8217;ll be giving at the Teaching Practices Colloquium next week.</p>
<p>T&#8217;was a good day.</p>
