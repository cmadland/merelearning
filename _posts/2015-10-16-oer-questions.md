As I've been reading some articles on OER evaluation, some questions are starting to bubble up, such as:

* Compare COM, OER, and OER+f assigned learning activities based on SOLO taxonomy.
* Compare COM, OER, and OER+f based on student approach to learning

I'm quite interested in how the SOLO taxonomy might inform the conversation around how OER changes how faculty use OER and how students' approaches vary as a result.

I'm also interested in WordPress as an example of an open technology that can be used to support open pedagogy as in the <a href="http://splot.ca" target="_blank">SPLOT</a> tools developed by Alan Levine and Brian Lamb.
