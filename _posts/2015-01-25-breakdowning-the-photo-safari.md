My <a title="Photo Safari" href="http://lab.merelearning.ca/learning/photo-safari/">previous post</a>, the results of the photo safari, was a bit of a parallax-gasm, no? If you are wondering, parallax is that funky effect that has the background and foreground of a post moving at different speeds. It creates a nice illusion of depth on the page and <em>can</em> be done really well.

I’m not convinced that my photo safari report would fall into the category of ‘well-done parallax’, but I am willing to chalk it up to learning about how to create parallax pages, how much is too much, how to size the images, and just how much futzing about it takes to build a parallax section.

Yesterday’s post included too much parallax, IMO, and it took too long to create. If you had been paying attention, you would have seen that I accidentally published the post long before it was ready (I don’t think the premature post was syndicated on YouShow.) Part of the reason for this is that I had to preview the post numerous times to check on things before ‘go live’. One of those ‘previews’ ended up being a ‘publish.’

As far as the actual images are concerned, most of them worked fairly well, although the monochrome image of the tyre was a little out of focus because it was taken too close with an iPhone camera. Same holds true for the unique angle of my saddle. The foreground of the image is actually in focus, but the parallax settings only show the top half. I presume I could change that in some magical CSS somewhere.

You can click on any of the images below for biggeryness.

I like the juxtaposition in the ‘dark’ image with my reflective sticker working its magic in the flash (I actually planned that!). The one with my son’s hand turned out pretty well also. I completely forgot that I took the pic of my Bike to Work Week sticker as an image that portrays creativity.

I also like how clever I was in capturing ‘complexity’ with a cog that has been de-complexified.

The one I was most worried about capturing in the context of my bike was a human emotion. How do you think I did?
