Here is an interesting infographic on the idea of the Flipped Classroom.

While there are some great ideas associated with flipping things, I find it curious that the model still relies heavily on lectures as the primary source of information for students. The only difference is that the lectures are consumed at home. Perhaps the improvements come from some form of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne Effect</a>.

IMO, school should happen AT school, and that includes giving students time to interact with material, both new and old. What students do is more important than what teachers do when it comes to learning. I like the idea of using mini-lectures in a flipped model, but why can't those happen during class time? Wouldn't that be the best of both worlds?
