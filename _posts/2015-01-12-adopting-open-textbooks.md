I've signed up to participate in the <a href="http://adoptotb.com" target="_blank">Adopting Open Textbooks</a> workshop hosted (in the open) by the good folks at BCCampus.

I'll be sharing my thoughts and responses here in the category 'adoptOTB' and on Twitter using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/adoptotb" target="_blank">#adoptOTB</a>.

The workshop is free and open, and I encourage you to sign up to participate!
