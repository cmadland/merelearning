<p>Everything works fine dong so on another blog I host, but not here.</p>
<p>Also, I have an idea on how to make presentations more engaging AND accessible after the fact. The idea seems to require some wizardous themery, so, I&#8217;ve bought into a theme club from <a href="http://themify.me/" >Themify</a>. They have a 30% off sale for January right now.</p>

<p>Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
