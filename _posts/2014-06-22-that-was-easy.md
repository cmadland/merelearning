A couple days ago, I (belatedly) signed up with <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com" target="_blank">Reclaim Hosting</a>. If you are at all interested in managingÂ your own domain, I highly recommend that you give Reclaim a little cash (45 USD for the pro/faculty package). It was super easy; in about half an hour, I went from only having a blog hosted at wordpress.com to having my own domain name (.ca, no less) and wordpress installed and ready to go. What is more, I did it from my iPhone while helping my son write a cover letter.

Not only do the folks at Reclaim give you 5GB of space, but you can install any number of web apps like WordPress, Moodle, Mahara, Drupal, ELGG...the list goes on. Even better, you have cPanel access so you can customize your installations.

If you'd like to know more about Reclaim Hosting, I recommend you check out <a href="http://www.educause.edu/visuals/shared/er/extras/2014/ReclaimingInnovation/default.html" target="_blank">THIS</a> article in the June 2014 EDUCAUSE Review. It will take you a few minutes to get through the whole thing, but it is highly recommended.

All for now.
