<p>I have, along with my wife and kids, made the rather significant decision to resign from my position as edtech coordinator at TRU, and accept a position as director of TWU Online at Trinity Western University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oy vey!</p>
<p>It's one of those positions that doesn't come along very often at all, represents a meaningful professional challenge, and will allow me to extend and expand on the work I've been involved with at TRU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it's relevant to note that I wasn't looking to leave TRU. There are some extremely talented and passionate people there who are doing amazing work with shrinking resources. I'm sad to leave.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>TWU represents a huge opportunity. They don't really have a coherent online strategy other than a few faculty and departments offering 'online' courses off the side of their desks. If you follow the most obvious links from the main page of the site, you will find a list of courses with links to year-old syllabi repurposed for online by adding required online discussions.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that the task before me is huge, but I'm excited. The potential is huge. Since TWU doesn't have a history in online learning, they don't have any ties to software systems or vendors. No Blackboard. No Brightspace. Just an old, rickety version of Moodle (1.9).</p>
<p>So, it is my sincere hope that I'll be able to leapfrog the last couple decades of increasingly bloated LMSs and build an <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/domain-of-ones-own/" target="_blank">open infrastructure</a>, with&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">open</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://sandstorm.io/" target="_blank">tools</a> to allow&nbsp;<a href="https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/4691" target="_blank">open pedagogies</a> and an&nbsp;<a href="https://catherinecronin.wordpress.com/2016/05/23/thoughts-on-oer16/" target="_blank">open invitation to participate</a> in a vibrant learning community.</p>
