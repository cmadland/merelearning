This year for school,  I chose to do an independent study in creative writing.  It was either that or guitar...  A bit of a no brainer for me.

It's been a bit of a learning curve, but so far it's great.  Having a whole block to be in the library writing a story is awesome.

One of my first assignments was to make a rubric for myself.  I got a lot of help from my dad, which was really nice, and I got to figure out what kind of writing standards I wanted to set for myself.  And since dad convinced me to do this blog page, I figured I should post it on <a title="Creative Writing Rubric" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FM1SQUDnQve1fumveFmPptsx9uakC65Fm5DS7CZyrq0/edit" target="_blank">here</a>.
