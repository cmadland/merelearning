The <a href="http://oeru.org/" target="_blank">OERu</a> is offering a <a href="http://ds4oer.oeru.org" target="_blank">mOOC</a> (micro Open Online Course), although I see it as more of a '<a href="http://connectedcourses.net/" target="_blank">Connected Course</a>', and cringe a little at being associated with MOOCs as envisioned by the likes of EdX, Coursera, and the like.

The course, linked above, is called <em>Digital Skills for Collaborative OER Development</em> and you too can register and take the course for free! Alternately, you can hitch yourself to the social media tag #DS4OER on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DS4OER&amp;src=savs" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/110630372080541511530" target="_blank">Google+</a>, or <a href="http://ds4oer.oeru.org/interactions/course-feed/" target="_blank">wikieducator</a> and just follow the flow.

My first task for the course is to provide a declaration of my intent to participate. That declaration is to include an image, so, in the spirit of two birds with one stone...

I'm looking forward to this course as I am acutely interested in designing open courses, and specifically doing so in WordPress. You can see the course that I have recently developed at the <a href="http://courses.olblogs.tru.ca/facdev/welcome-2/" target="_blank">TRU WP course site</a>. Also, having recently completed my M.Ed., I'm interested in connecting more deeply with the OER community as I consider options for future study.

Feel free to explore my site, which like a good blog, is forever in beta.
