I love it when the various circles I'm in intersect in interesting ways. Currently I'm participating in <a href="http://twitter.com/#youshow15" target="_blank">#youshow15</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/adoptotb" target="_blank">#adoptotb</a>, both open learning opportunities hosted by some great people.

This morning <a href="http://twitter.com/brlamb" target="_blank">Brian</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/cogdog" target="_blank">Alan</a> led YouShow participants through some ideas related to digital storytelling and Alan mentioned a video on YouTube, although I can't recall the context of his mention.

As I was going through my notes after the session, I found the video and it captures perfectly the ethos ofÂ  what I think open education should be.

There really is something magical that happens when you open your work to a wide audience and tell them that they can remix it.
