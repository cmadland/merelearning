<p>I received some good feedback on my post <a title="structuring my show" href="http://lab.merelearning.ca/learning/structuring-my-show/" >structuring my show</a>, specifically to do with using categories and tags for different levels of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>As I look at Alan&#8217;s advice in light of my proposed structure, it seems that when I will use categories for the verbs (blue in v2) and tags or portfolio types for the nouns (other fancy colours).</p>
<p>Alan managed to translate my slightly off-centre request to add an RSS feed into something that works better than I was thinking, and now my portfolio projects are being syndicated on the main site. The first project thatÂ  is being fed in there starts at &#8216;Interaction&#8217; in green in the image below.</p>
<p><a href="http://lab.merelearning.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/My-Gig-v2.jpeg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-54" src="http://lab.merelearning.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/My-Gig-v2.jpeg" alt="My Gig v2" width="640" height="466" /></a></p>
<p>So, now I have a wee problem.</p>
<p>I built a nice category hierarchy in the portfolio tool, thinking I could create a custom menu to organize the display of my work. However&#8230;I can&#8217;t use &#8216;portfolio types&#8217; to populate a menu. I can only use categories.</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;off to the drop-in hack session.</p>
