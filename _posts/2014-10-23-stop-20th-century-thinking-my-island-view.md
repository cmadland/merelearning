Here is an excellent follow up to part of my <a title="Pressuring Public Education" href="http://merelearning.ca/education/pressuring-public-education/" target="_blank">post from yesterday</a>. This comes from Tom Whitby, whose blog is a must-read.

Tom warns of the dangers of imposing modern technologies onto 19th century teaching methods. It doesn't work.
