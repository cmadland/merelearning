<p>I&#8217;m going a little meta on this post&#8230;</p>

<p>My wife and I were somewhat lazily enjoying this Saturday morning over coffee and a smoothie, chatting about the YouShow and such. She mentioned that she always feels like the stuff that she might blog about is so very mundane, perhaps even <a href="http://mrsslatersparrot.trubox.ca/2015/01/15/life-lurches-on/" >banal</a>. Who would be interested in reading about her thoughts? How boring&#8230;</p>
<p>So, I mentioned a few of the ideas that I&#8217;ve encountered about just writing down what you are thinking about and the power of being reflective and just putting it out there. Just see what happens.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, I found a ridiculously interesting article and pushed my computer over closer to her so that we could read it together. It was a good 10-minute read and it had us riveted.</p>
<p>It was about the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/14/history-of-water-fountains_n_6357064.html" >history of public water fountains</a>.</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>It was very much a meta moment. And now this post is going inception-level meta because here I am writing a mundane post about talking about mundane posts and then reading a mundane article to learn that mundane posts aren&#8217;t always mundane for everyone.</p>
