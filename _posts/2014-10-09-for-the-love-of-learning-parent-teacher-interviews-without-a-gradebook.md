<a href="http://www.joebower.org/2014/10/parent-teacher-interviews-without.html">for the love of learning: Parent-Teacher Interviews without a gradebook</a>.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.joebower.org/p/quick-bio.html" target="_blank">Joe Bower</a> for posting this.

My wife and I spent 25 minutes last night having just this conversation with my son's grade 1 teacher last night.

It was great to hear that he is doing well and is progressing at a rate that is normal for his age. <em>But the real point is that his teacher based her comments on her personal experience of sitting with my son and having him read to her.</em> It wasn't based on a number in a spreadsheet...she didn't even have a spreadsheet in front of her.
