For the last hour of our scheduled time at the OLFM workshop a couple weekends ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/vpeachey" target="_blank">@vpeachey</a> and I facilitated what we called a Conversation Café.

We had loosely divided attendees into 5 largish groups of about 20 by putting coloured stickers on their conference nametags. They were instructed to consult their conference package for a list of five questions that had each been assigned to one of the groups. Then, throughout the conference, they were on their own to gather with any number of people in their colour to chat about the question and identify some related ideas. Then, at the end of the day on Saturday, we gathered together in the Theatre, broke into the coloured groups and recorded some ideas on flip-chart paper. Finally, we asked each group to prioritize their top three reponses to share with the larger group.

Here are the questions we asked, along with the notes from each group (HT to <a href="http://twitter.com/mddyck" target="_blank">@mddyck</a> for the questions):
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3>PINK Group: In your opinion, what are three of the most important, ongoing concerns about ethics within increasingly digital forms of knowledge dissemination?</h3>

 	<li>
<h3>BLUE Group: As we increasingly rely on algorithms and computerized data analysis, what do we think about the role of this analysis in learning? Can it accurately replicate human analysis? Also, who is perhaps watching our students as they learn?</h3>

 	<li>
<h3>RED Group: What will the world be like for our learners 10 or 15 years from now? What trends do you see in the evolution of online education?</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5038" src="http://merelearning.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2818-1024x651.jpg" alt="IMG_2818" width="1024" height="651" /></li>
 	<li>
<h3>ORANGE Group: As technology becomes more capable of simulating reality, what concerns or issues do you see arising for learners or educators?</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5040" src="http://merelearning.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2820-768x1024.jpg" alt="IMG_2820" width="768" height="1024" /></li>
 	<li>
<h3>GREEN Group: The internet has allowed online education to blossom in recent years – how can we can all encourage students to consider TRU-OL as their primary choice in this increasingly competitive world?</h3>
</li>
</ol>

As a further step in processing these questions, I've asked some people both inside and outside OL to comment on the questions and/or the responses that were gathered at the conference. Their responses are/will be below in various formats.
